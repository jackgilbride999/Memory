SymmetricDifference.s is a simple program which takes the symmetric difference of two sets A and B, placing it into a third set C. I.e. C = A/B U B/A. A is a set of size ASize whose elements are word sized values located in AElems. B is a set of size BSize whose elements are word sized and located in BElems. C's elements are stored in CElems and its size is stored in CSize by the program.
